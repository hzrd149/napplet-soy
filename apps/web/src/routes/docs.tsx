              Selection is shared by soyLI projects on that network. Your next publication uses the

            <h3>Create another identity</h3>
            <p>
              <code>soyli account create</code> creates a key only when no identity is selected.

              <strong>Each public key has its own releases.</strong> Switching to a remote signer
              for the same public key continues the same listing. A different public key creates a

              Local signing keys live in your OS credential store. Creation also saves an

              New remote connections use a private session file outside your project. Your Nostr
              private key stays with the signer, and publishing needs no Keychain access. Add{' '}
              <code>--session-storage keychain</code> to connect or pair if you prefer the OS vault.
              Use <code>soyli account show</code> to see the current choice.

              {'soyli account storage file'}
            </DocCommand>
            <p>
              This keeps your existing pairing. Allow access to the old vault once; subsequent
              publishing reads the private file. Local private-key accounts keep using the OS vault.

              Website sign-in is separate. Use the identity button to select a saved account or

              In <code>soyli dev</code>, switch from Play to Listing to inspect the name,
              description, tags, creator, cover, video and upload destinations. Edit portable

              The screenshot is a PNG; the optional clip is a short, silent WebM. Both are selected
              in <code>napplet.json</code>. Review them before your next checkpoint. Existing files
              are preserved: use a new name such as <code>soyli screenshot preview-2.png</code> for
              another capture.
            </p>
            <p>
              A changed build needs a fresh clip, or you can remove <code>preview.video</code>.
              Without a selected cover, publication captures one automatically. A deliberately
              chosen scene usually makes a better first impression.
            </p>
            <h3>Sounds, images, fonts and other files</h3>
            <p>
              Keep small assets in <code>src/assets/</code> and import them through the starter’s
              build, for example <code>import imageUrl from './assets/player.png?url'</code>. CSS
              font URLs work too. The single-file build embeds them in the finished HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
              Simply dropping a file next to the napplet or using a <code>/assets/…</code> path does
              not make it available after publication. Larger external resources need the supported
              resource/media capabilities and their declared requirements. See the{' '}

              Save a <code>soyli checkpoint "Describe the change"</code> before either action.
              Proposals preserve Git ancestry and use Nostr Git events, so ordinary Git/ngit tools
              can inspect the work. Run propose again after a new checkpoint to update the same

              changes section also lets people play and discuss a proposal.{' '}

              soyLI includes guidance and a shared host for CVM scoreboards, matchmaking and
              NAP-WEBRTC peer connections. Your napplet supplies the game rules and synchronization;
              the host handles signaling and transport.

              Read the generated <code>docs/napplet-backend.md</code> with your coding agent.
              Declare scoreboards and required capabilities, then use <code>soyli dev</code> for
              isolated local backend data. Preview scores do not go to the public board.

              soyLI 0.16.0 adds a Controller tester to the workshop. Pair a USB or Bluetooth
              controller, open the tester, click inside it and press a controller button. Inspect
              buttons and sticks, adjust dead zones and try a mapping in the napplet sandbox.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ask your agent to add controller support using{' '}
              <code>docs/napplet-controllers.md</code> and the bundled input helper. Existing
              projects receive them through <code>soyli skills update</code>. Your game connects the
              controls to its actions and keeps keyboard and touch alternatives. No account or
              backend is needed for input.

              Shared uploads may be retained. Soy’s Git server keeps a recovery archive for 90 days.
              Copies, forks and independent mirrors cannot be recalled. Republish creates a fresh
              listing; old pinned release links stay unpublished.
